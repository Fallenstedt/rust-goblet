# WebAssembly Gobblet
![Rust + Webpack](https://github.com/Fallenstedt/rust-goblet/workflows/Rust%20+%20Webpack/badge.svg)

This is a simple canvas based game called [Gobblet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobblet).

## Setup

A simple 'yarn' and 'yarn start' should do the trick. File an issue if it doesn't!

`src` is where your rust code can go. `js` is where you can find your react :) 

TODO

Make the pieces different shades of yellow and red
